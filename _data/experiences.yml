      In this role I was responsible to keep all infrastructure up and running. Also was under my responsabilities keep costs under control and supplier contracts.
      The principal remark of this period was when I led the migration of all infrastructure between regions in GCP (from São Paulo to Virginia).
      The process included some kubernetes clusters, dozen of postgresql and redis instances.
      Together with SRE, DBRE and infrastructure teams we were able to migrate everything in one night and only less than few hours of systems downtime.
